For the past 15 years, Iâ€™ve worked as product designer. I have had the pleasure of collaborating for companies like HCL Technologies, Citynews, Doralab, Inarea, Shinyfrog, Comtaste, Seejay (and more) following clients such **Ferrari**, **Enel**, **ING Direct**, **Noema Life**, **Dondup**.

In March 2022 I've joined [Italian Department for Digital Transformation](https://innovazione.gov.it/dipartimento/) as **Senior Product Designer**.

Back in 2010 I co-fouded **Robodomain** with my friend [@weppos](https://www.simonecarletti.com), a software company focused on domains management tools. In 2013 [DNSimple acquired](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2012/09/dnsimple-acquires-robodomain/) and integrated the software in their product suite. It was such a exciting, difficult but beautiful experience.

Occasionally I write and talk about design methodologies, workflow and tools at conferences and events. I'm lecturer at **UXUniversity** having a [full-day workshop](https://www.uxuniversity.it/11/c_13/design-systems) about **Design Systems and Atomic Design**.
