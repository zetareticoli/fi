    <p>
      For the past 15 years, I've worked as a <strong>Product Designer</strong> designing and building a wide range of digital products. I believe that good design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and strive to create intuitive and engaging user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my career, I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of clients in fields such as Editorial, Healthcare, Banking, Sports, Public Administration, E-commerce, and Information Technology. <br>Some of my notable clients include <strong>Scuderia Ferrari F1</strong>, Enel Energia, <strong>ING Direct</strong>, and <strong>HCL Software</strong>. Most recently, I served as a Senior Product Designer at the Italian Department for Digital Transformation, where I managed complex ecosystems of user interfaces and front-end libraries for key government initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my work as a designer, I co-founded <strong>Robodomain</strong>, a SaaS company focused on domain management tools. Our software was acquired by DNSimple in 2013, which was a valuable learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, I <strong>write</strong> and <strong>speak</strong> about design methodologies, workflow, and tools at conferences and events. I am also a lecturer at UXUniversity, where I conduct a full-day workshop on Design Systems and Atomic Design.
