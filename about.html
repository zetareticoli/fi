  <p>
    For the past 15 years I’ve worked as Product Designer, designining and building a wide-range of digital products. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I had the opportunity and pleasure to work in different fields — Editorial, Healthcare, Banking, Sports, PA, E-commerce, Information Technology — following companies such as Scuderia Ferrari F1, Enel Energia, ING Direct, INPS, Citynews, Noemalife, Dondup and more. In 2021 I’ve joined HCL Software — a division of HCL Technologies —  as Senior UX Designer for the BigFix product. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in 2010 I co-fouded Robodomain, a SaaS company focused on domains management tools. In 2013 I completed my exit when DNSimple acquired our software, integrating it in their product suite. It was one of those experiences that taught me so much. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Occasionally I write and talk about design methodologies, workflow and tools at conferences and events. I’m lecturer at UXUniversity having a <a href="/workshops">full-day workshop</a> about Design Systems and Atomic Design.
