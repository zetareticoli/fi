## Technical details
The component library itself is a lerna/yarn monorepo based on React and Styled Component built with Emotion. Each component of the DDS library was a yarn workspace package that let us build, test and release them individually and also as a whole. Additionally, each component would provide its own MDX documentation that would get bundled in a DocZ website which served as our internal documentation explaining how each component had to be used to all the other frontend developers at Docker

## Personal growth
This frontend project was perhaps the biggest internal project I got to work on. Its scope spanned across the whole product development org at Docker and brought together what was a disjoint product experience to a single unique vision for Docker UIs. I got to learn a lot about automating the testing and publishing phase while working on this project. I've never got to play with tools such as Jenkins before, but this project was the perfect opportunity to learn more about it. Additionally, I got to work a lot on specs and documentation, which were key for this project to be successful.
