          I enjoy developing, learning, teaching, and working with colleagues who are honest, respectful, and provide direct feedback. I believe that the team is crucial, and it's important to understand not only their skills but also their personalities.

          Thorough research is essential in every project, as it helps us understand the business and its users. Ideation takes various forms, but it's crucial to rapidly test ideas with real users to ensure that we're headed in the right direction.
