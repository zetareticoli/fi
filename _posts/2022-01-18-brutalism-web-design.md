In the era of Design Systems, where consistency, coherence and uniformity are the masters, it's quite impressive (and nice) to see **a new trend emerge**, the Brutalism Web Design.

## Origins

**Brutalism** is an **architectural style** that became popular in the 1950s and up to the 1980s. The term derives from the french phrase *"b√©ton brut"* which means *"rough concrete"*.

In particular, **institutional or civic buildings** adopted this style. These were seen by most people as very **hostile, ugly and intimidating**.

## A new trend?

Yes, but what does web design have to do with it?

The reason why this **style of web design** takes its name from the architectural one lies in the **same emotions** it evokes.

Furthermore, the strange appearance of these websites is also attributed to a willingness to differentiate themselves from the global standard. Today, websites look all the same. 

Let's see some characteristics of a "brutalist" website:
- Black or white backgrounds
- No gradient or shadow
- Overlapping elements
- Lack of symmetry
- Crowded design
- No distinct hierarchy
- Monospaced typography
- One font used throughout
- Colors with strong contrast
- No animation
- Scattered images
- Simple or non-existent navigation
- One page layout

If you're curious about this visual trend, you can take a look to these collections:

## A jump into the past

This style takes us back to the past, when **the web** was above all **a place of experimentation**.

Probably none of the sites meets the minimum accessibility criteria.

But, how much have all these guidelines influenced our creativity in a good way?
