2025 has been a year of building. Slowly, deliberately, and often behind the scenes. It’s been less about chasing trends and more about turning ideas I’ve had for a long time into something concrete, usable, and shared with others.

## Teaching Design Systems, one workshop at a time

This year I officially launched my workshops dedicated to **Design Systems**, with a strong focus on **Interface Inventory** and **Design Tokens**. They’re the kind of work that usually gets postponed, underestimated, or rushed and then comes back as technical debt.

The goal of these workshops was simple: help designers and developers step back, observe what already exists, and turn chaos into structure.

- **[Interface Inventory Workshop](/workshops/interface-inventory)** as a way to *see* the product for what it really is
- **[Design Tokens Workshop](/workshops/design-tokens)** as a shared language between design and code

The Interface Inventory workshop reached over 5 classes this year, and the Design Tokens workshop is quickly catching up. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with many attendees reporting immediate improvements in their design systems and workflows.

What I enjoyed most was watching people recognize the same problems I've faced for years, and realizing they're not alone in that struggle.

## Back to public speaking: Accessibility Days, Milan

2025 also marked my return to **public speaking**.

I had the chance to speak at **Accessibility Days in Milan**, an event that has become a key reference point in Italy for accessibility and inclusive design. Getting back on stage after some time away was both exciting and grounding.

My talk focused on **accessibility and Design Systems in the Italian context.**

It felt good to bring together topics I deeply care about: accessibility, design systems, and real-world constraints, discussing them with a community that’s actively trying to improve things.

## Building an app I’ve wanted for years

Alongside teaching and speaking, I’ve been working on **Token Lens** an app dedicated to design tokens and production code.

It’s a project that has been in my head for a long time.

As a designer who’s comfortable writing code, I’ve always felt a strong friction:we define solid design system foundations, but *verifying their correct application* is still painfully manual.

Design Tokens exist. Documentation exists. But control, validation, and real-world usage? That’s where things break.

This app is my attempt to solve common problems around design tokens by:

- focusing on *values*, not naming conventions
- helping teams understand what’s actually being used in production
- making design system governance less fragile and less subjective

It’s still work in progress but I’m excited about the potential impact it could have on how teams manage design systems.

Beta release is planned for january 2026. Stay tuned!

## Growing newsletters into something real

Another milestone of 2025: I passed **1,000+ subscribers** across my two newsletters, **Designabile** and **Design Tokens Pills**.

Even more meaningful: I received my first **paying subscribers**.

That changed my perspective. It’s one thing when people read what you write. It’s another when they decide it’s worth supporting financially.

These newsletters have become a space where I can think out loud and share lessons from real projects, not theoretical frameworks

No growth hacks. No aggressive funnels. Just keep writing each month.

### Closing thoughts

Managing different projects simultaneously is not easy. 

There are days when I feel lost, when even the simplest tasks seem impossible. 

This year I tried to apply a simple principle: adapt my productivity to my mental state, without forcing it. I hope to continue in the same way in the new year.

Thanks to everyone who followed along, joined a workshop, subscribed, attended a talk, or simply sent a thoughtful message.

More to come.
