From March of this year I joined the [Italian Digital Transformation Team](https://innovazione.gov.it).

It had only been a few months since the [last company change](https://francescoimprota.com/2021/04/28/leaving-citynews/) but, when I saw that there was this chance, I didn't think twice about applying.

I had already participated in the past - just in the middle of pandemic -  to another selection for a different position. Despite having passed the first selection phase, nothing was done.

I have always thought that there is no better opportunity than putting my experience and my knowledge in the field of Product Design *(UX, UI, Project Management, Front-end)* at the service of the State and people - all of us in short.

Being able to contribute to the development of the country's **Design System** and more generally to the services digitalization for the people are the reasons that convinced me to accept this new adventure.
