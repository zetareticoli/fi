*“Writing documentation is a boring job. In addition, it's upon the dev team because of coding. "*

This reasonable statement is the classic designer's parachute. 
Above all because of the code.

I think it comes from a legacy of a past where software solely was designed, coded and documented by computer engineers.

Designers were late to the party. 
So, we adapted to a pre-established system.

Today, however, we could lead the entire process, acting as a link between teams, departments and stakeholders  - or rather must do.

**We are privileged. We just have to make good use of it.**

For this reason, I believe that anyone who loves (and cares) designing software interfaces cannot refrain from the task of documenting the patterns library that he himself has designed or contributed to.

**Dimensions, styles, variants, content**. All these are **design elements**. 

We shape them in out preferred design tool. 
We makes choices, foresees scenarios.
So, we are the repository of **meaningful information** that must end up in the patterns library.

Our work never ends up with a mockup or a Design Kit.

*But naming things is freaking hard*

I read this sentence on a lot of websites, blogs, LinkedIn posts and more. 
Well, it's true. If we can't describe what we create, we've have done half the work.

## Patterns or Components?

A pattern library - which may also be referred to as a **component library** - is a central and digitalized collection of a brand’s reusable assets.

It's totally different from a Design Kit. 
It lives in the browser. 
And you have **to know little about code** to work on it.

Today, the designer's toolbox get expanded: Fractal, Style Dictionary, Storybook and more. 

You simply can't avoid to know and use them.

## The Pattern Card

In my workshop on Design System there is a moment of practical exercise in which I ask participants to try their hand at a pattern card.

It's interesting - and fun - to see the **people reaction** (90% are designers) putted in front of this task. They are quite **confused**. They **don't know where to start** or what kind of information they have to write, even though they know those UI elements.

### What Include
Let's see what kind of info we need to put in it:

- **Pattern Name** - use a name you and your team can memorize and quickly refer to
- **Description** - succint description of the pattern focusing on what it allows to do, not what it is
- **Usage** - what do users need to know in order to properly implement this pattern? Discuss any UX, visual, frontend, accessibility, content, backend, etc considerations. **Show do's and dont's**. When should users consider an alternative pattern? Include links to internal and external resources.
- **Variants** - specifiy any pattern variations: size, spacing, colors, etc.
- **Preview** - live preview of the pattern
- **Code** - the pattern template (HTML or whatever) and related assets (CSS, Sass, Javascript)
- **Meta Info** - additional informations like pattern's status (work in progress, draft or published), changelog, version number, dependencies or anything more that you need

## Benefits

Getting your hands dirty with a Pattern Library will bring you **three key benefits** as designer:
1. Increase your **product knowledge**, following all steps of the project from rough sketches to final implementation
2. Improve **communication** with developers, speaking the same language,
3. Be aware of **technical constraints**, making more aware design decisions

## Exercise Yourself

Now, I'd like to do the same exercise with you. Think of a pattern/component you have been working on recently and describe it.

You can use the file I prepared for my workshop (made in Markdown, but choose the format you're most comfortable with).

[Download the pattern card template](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/zetareticoli/e1f192885e6eabc62178a3a693d29c92/raw/23fae40532553009014ef2618ff11a06b0e2530a/gistfile1.txt)

When you are done, you could **share your work with me** if you want (write at me[at]francescoimprota.com)

I would love to discuss it together.
