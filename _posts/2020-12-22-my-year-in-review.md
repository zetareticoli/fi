This is my first year-in-review post, probably because I'm writing a blog for the very first time. This is that kind of post which nobody cares about except who writes. BUT. I think it's a nice way to rethink and summarize all the things done. 

## 2020
We will remember you forever. Coronavirus pandemic has changed our lives and working habits. I don't know if we'll go back to our former lives. Maybe we will never go back. I like to think about what good this can mean: a better quality of life, balancing free time and work, and greater respect for the environment

## it hasn't all be bad

### Real life

My second child was born on May 27th. I would never have imagined becoming a father a second time also because the first one is almost 9 years old. It was the greatest joy of this year. All the difficulties I thought about disappeared from his first day of life. Seeing the two brothers growing up together today is the best thing there is.

### Professional life

The big news is that in 2020, during the first hard lockdown in Italy, I launched my personal website and blog. But it was a very productive year for many other reasons. So, let's see them:

- **232** contributions on GitHub, on both private and public repositories
  ![dark-mode-toggle](/img/posts/2020-year-review/2020-github-contributions.png)
- Managed **137** tasks across **4** projects 
- Built the first **styleguide & pattern library** for Citynews products -- a design system is on the way
- Wrote [**7 posts**](/blog) on my blog, [**2 stories**](https://medium.com/@zetareticoli) on Medium and [**1 article**](https://dev.to/zetareticoli/dark-mode-with-sass-and-css-variables-4f9b) on DEV
- Published **Typesmith** on [GitHub](https://github.com/zetareticoli/typesmith) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typesmith-lib), a Sass responsive typography library
- Be **productive** for an average of 75% of my working time, tracked with RescueTime app

## what's next

My new year resolutions are a collection of "go back to...". Here's what:
- go back to **physical training**, because the new born cutted off my free time at all
- go back to **sleep 6 hrs** per night, same cause as above
- go back to **travel**
- go back to having fun in the free time (restaurants, pub, clubs, cinema)
- continue **making new open-source** and side projects
- write more on every kind of platform sharing my experience, projects and more
- see if new job opportunities arise

That's it. We all look forward to leaving this year behind. Wish you the best for new year to come.
