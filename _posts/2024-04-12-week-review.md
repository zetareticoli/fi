Every Friday at noon, I take the time to conduct a thorough review of my week. This has become an essential part of my routine and it helps me stay organized, focused, and motivated.

The process begins by setting up a **recurring task** on [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com). This task comes with a list of subtasks that guide me through my review.

The first step is to **close all distractions**. This is crucial in helping me to focus solely on the task at hand and reflect on the week without any interruptions.

Next, I **review projects to-do lists**. This allows me to see what tasks were completed, what's still pending, and what needs my immediate attention.

For any uncompleted tasks, I don't beat myself up; instead, I either **postpon**e them or **set a new due date**. This helps keep my task list manageable and ensures that no task is forgotten or left behind.

Now comes the most important part of my weekly review: filling out my **week review sheet** in [Notion](https://notion.so). This sheet has several fields that help me evaluate my week effectively. These fields include:
- what went well;
- what went wrong;
- start to do; 
- stop to do;
- completed [pomodoros](/_posts/2024-01-11-100-pomodoro);
- next actions.

To make my week review more personal and engaging, I often **give it a title** and attach an image. This not only makes the review more visually appealing but also makes it easier to reference in the future.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I take a moment to **celebrate my successes**, no matter how big or small. This act of self-appreciation motivates me to keep pushing forward and strive for success in the upcoming week.

This is my weekly Friday noon review - a simple yet effective way of keeping myself accountable, tracking my progress, and setting myself up for success.
