2023 is shaping up to be a thrilling chapter in my professional adventure! Right now, I'm navigating the mid-point of an inspiring journey with Designers Italia and the Department for Digital Transformation. The upcoming two years promise to be pivotal in bringing all our wonderful plans to life.

Recently, I've been lucky enough to witness the launch of the project **[UI Kit Italia](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105848677422572920)** and the unveiling of **[.italia](https://designers.italia.it/design-system/)**, the Italian GOV's design system. The results of this work will bring a positive change to the new website templates we're crafting for Italian ASLs and civic museums. These projects will pioneer the use of our design system's principles and components right from the get-go.

On a personal note, I'm absolutely thrilled to have launched my very first product, **[Design Tokens Manager](https://www.notion.so/templates/design-tokens-manager-for-notion)**. It's a handy Notion template that smoothly manages a relational database for design tokens, and it's **[up for grabs on Gumroad](https://zetareticoli.gumroad.com/l/design-tokens-manager)**.

In the same vein, this year saw the birth of the first newsletter completely devoted to design tokens: **[Design Tokens Pills](https://designtokens.substack.com/)**. I love sharing both theoretical insights and practical advice from time to time.

This year also marked my return to the world of teaching, this time to the advanced course in **User Interface Design** organized by [POLI.design](http://poli.design/). I was excited to share my experiences in crafting complex Design systems and utilizing effective methods like Atomic Design.

This teaching stint reminded me of how valuable my day-to-day work experiences are and how rewarding it is to share them. That's why I'm gearing up to create a **course** **focused** on creating and **managing** **design** **tokens**. 

In January 2024, **[Designabile](https://designabile.substack.com/)** will be celebrating its 2nd birthday ðŸŽ‰ I never envisioned maintaining this level of consistency in publishing a new issue month after month. It's true that consistent writing demands considerable effort (more than one could ever guess), but boy, is it satisfying!

As I look forward to the new year, two resolutions top my list: to **read** and to **travel** more!
