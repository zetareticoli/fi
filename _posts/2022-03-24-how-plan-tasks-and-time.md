I have always highly esteemed all those people who manage to carry out side projects with a certain regularity.

Whether it's a blog, a newsletter, a personal website or a real product, finding the time to combine work (the official one), family / life (the real one) with everything else has always been a concern of mine.

For the past two years, I've blogged on my personal website, [launched a newsletter](https://www.designabile.com), [build a open-source project](https://www.cssui.dev), [run a workshop](https://www.francescoimprota.com/workshop) and have plans to do more each year.

To be able to keep up with everything — by regularly publishing content and news — I had to design an intelligent planning, capable of adapting to the commitments of real life.

## 1. Group tasks by categories

I created a list of projects and things to do by grouping them into 4 macro areas (or categories):

1. **Making** - side projects, open source projects, anything that lands in something “real”
2. **Writing** - blog, newsletter, social posts, books, etc
3. **Learning** - courses and workshops, conf
4. **Teaching** - workshop or online courses

These categories have become the todo app projects that I use every day (todolist):

Giving each category a color helps into distinguish them in your todo list.

## 2. Plan time slots, every week
   
To be sure of carrying out the activities of each project, I assigned a day slot to each project, i.e. 1 or more days a week to be reserved for the activities of that category.

Considering a 5-day week (I always exclude Saturdays and Sundays), I landed with the following planning:

- 2 slot for **Making**
- 2 slot for **Writing**
- 1 slot for **Learning** and **Teaching**

A slot is a preset time box (half an hour, 1 hour, 2 hours). This assignment depends on effective amount of tasks I want to accomplish. 

I try to keep it simple and flexible. 

The plan should adapt to the **official work** load. Not the contrary.

## 3. Use a recurring schedule for tasks than span more days/weeks

I find pretty useful to set a recurring schedule for those tasks that don’t start and finish the same day. 

I always struggled with organizing that kind of activities. I know when they start but don’t when finish. There isn’t an exact deadline too.

![set deadline in todolist](/img/posts/plan-time/recurring-timing.png "Using a sentence to set time deadline")

In Todoist is pretty nice to use sentences for the deadline like “every 2 days” or “every Friday for 3 weeks”. 

## 4. Plan the next week on Sunday

At the end of each week, I plan the next trying to follow the timing schema explained before.

Landing to this workflow requested time. I changed idea and organization lot of times.

It depends on you.

Feel free to use it and let me know how’s going.
